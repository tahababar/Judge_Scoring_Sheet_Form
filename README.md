# Judge_Scoring_Sheet_Form
Completed this project during my web services internship with APPE

This is a form, similar to a normal google form, but a bit advanced than it as it supports features to automatically add/multiply/subtract and display multiple text inputs. The code contains HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP elements and can be edited to judge any competition globally. The JavaScript will automatically add the scores and declare the winner at the end of the form.
